#+TITLE: Scanning books

Use an [[https://files.support.epson.com/docid/cpd4/cpd40083/index.html][EPSON 4630]] to scan pages to a USB stick,
using the sheet feeder.  It will scan continuously
if you keep the feeder full, appending the pages
to the same file.  However, if you don't
put the next stack in before it takes the last page
in the current stack, it will end the current job
and start a new one.

This apparently causes it to overwrite the file.
