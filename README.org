#+TITLE: Gabriel Kron's Diakoptics

I was describing compositionality to a retired physicist.  He said
it reminded him of Gabriel Kron's work on systems analysis.

Kron developed a method of analyzing systems by "tearing" them
into sections, solving the sections, and then combining the
solutions to produce a solution to the system.

He was an interesting character who deserves to be celebrated
more than he has been.

Kron's books are long out of print and not easy to find.
I'm trying to collect and digitize some of it.
This repo is where I'm keeping notes and tooling for doing that.

Here are the books I've found so far:

* Diakoptics
  
  1963, 166 pages.
  This is the only one I've yet scanned.

* Tensors for Circuits
  
  This is a Dover edition paperback.

* Gabriel Kron and System Theory
  
  This is not Kron's own work, but rather a tribute
  by his friends and colleagues.
  Hardback.
